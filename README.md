# Software Design Document

The Gaming Room was a company that desired an application called Draw It or Lose It.  It was a game where the user would have to draw an image for a user to guess within the time limit.  In this design document I included the potential next steps for the company with consideration for cost and implimentation.  This included the differences between the operating systems considered for use for this application.  If I had revised the document I would dig deeper into the various operating systems considered for use.  I would do so by gearing my analysis to how the game worked vs the general format.  THe users needs are important to consider, what works for one particualar application cannot be applied to all of them.  In the future I would use past knowledge of similar applications to gain a starting point.  Arcitecture is a good way to gain such consistancy that can be applied to future projects.
